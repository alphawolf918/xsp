  ** Please do not claim this as your own, as I have screenshots and the exact date when I started the project. I will file charges if credit is taken for my work. This license may not change, and this copyright cannot be removed. If either of these are disputed, then this copy is no longer a legal one.
  ** IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE CODE AND WISH TO UPLOAD IT SEPARATELY, then please reference my original project via hyperlink. Do not claim yours as the "official" version, as that is what mine is. If I happen to see a change I wish to implement into the final version, then I will attempt to contact you to discuss it, so please leave some way for me to contact you as well. This is for your benefit, as I believe in teamwork very heavily. I do not, however, believe in theft. Thank you.

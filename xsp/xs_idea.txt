var file = open lazy XS file to be parsed
var index = where the parser is at in the file
while not the end of the stupid file
	set the parser to this location whether it likes it or not
	parse a line until a semicolon or a curly bracket is reached because it's too dumb to understand otherwise
	store this line in the interpreter
	if this line is in the keyword dictionary then
		perform action without complaining
	else
		throw up
	end if
	file = reread from file to remind its brain
	index = line below this one so no more messes are made
	ignore any stored lines already in interpreter
end while

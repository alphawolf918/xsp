These are various ideas that I have thought of from brain-storming over the future of the language. I hope to one day implement these as additions, not changes. XScript is to be XSP's version of JavaScript (while still on the server), and while it will share similar syntax, it will be a different language. I am currently looking for collaborators to help me on this project. If you are interested, please contact me using the e-mail address that I have provided.

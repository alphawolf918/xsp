	INSTALLATION
	[EXTENSIVE SERVER PATH]
	By Paul Shannon, Jr. / Zollern Wolf
============================================

1. First, download a PHP-enabled web server, such as WAMPServer (or set up IIS).
2. Once everything is setup, extract the files from the xsp.zip archive folder.
3. Place the "xsp" folder inside of the "www" folder.
4. Start the server and then load your browser (I use Firefox usually).
5. Type in http://localhost/xsp and hit Enter.
6. The console should load, and you can now start using XSP commands.

Happy parsing.
